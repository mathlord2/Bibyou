# Bibyou
Track your sources for all of your documents: https://bibyou.appspot.com/.
 
## How to Use
Once you open the website, press the **Login/Sign Up** button to login or create an account using your Gmail or email address. Once logged-in, you can create a source by clicking the **+ Add Document** button at the top-left in the navbar. Fill in the title of your document and press **Add Document**, creating a widget below the header for your document. You can click on your document widget to begin adding and editing sources.

### Adding a Source
Inside your document widget, click on the **+ Add Source** button at the top-left in the navbar, which leads to a purple overlay widget with three dropdown menus for your sources' settings. Choose the right settings, and then click **Create Source**, which leads to a couple of input fields that change based on your chosen settings. Fill in the inputs for your source, and click **Add Source**. This exits the overlay and adds the formatted source to your bibliography.

### Editing a Source
Click the pencil icon below the bibliography. This will convert your bibliography to a textarea which you can edit, with each line being a separate source. Once you click **Save**, the textarea will be converted back into a bibliography. Note: if you see *##* and *%%* symbols around text, clicking **Save** will convert that text to italics.

### Other Tools
Right beside the pencil icon, there is a **Copy to Clipboard** button that allows you to copy the sources to your clipboard and paste it onto another document. In the navbar, when a bibliography is open, there is a **Back** button that allows you to go to the main menu and a **Learn How to Cite** button that leads to a website where you can learn to cite sources yourself in a specific format. At the right side of the navbar is a **Sign Out** button that allows you to sign out of your account.
